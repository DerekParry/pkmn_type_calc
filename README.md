## Pokemon Type Calculator
This is a Python script that was written to show data for Pokemon type combinations that do not exist in the series yet. The script currently exports all type combinations along with their properties such as weaknesses, resistances, and immunities. Set operations (e.g. union, intersection, difference) allowed me to calculate these properties efficiently.
